Time is vital in today's society, and when it comes to certain electronics, timing is crucial; just like us, they require a means to keep track of time, and precise time. So, how do electronics accomplish this? A Real-Time Clock, or RTC, is a timekeeping device embedded inside an Integrated Circuit, or IC. The answer is DS1307. Many time-critical applications and devices rely on it, including servers, GPS, and data loggers.
